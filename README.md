# OHClays

## Getting Started üöÄ

For simplicity we use [Melos](https://pub.dev/packages/melos) to manage
multi-package project. Melos is a Dart tool for managing Dart projects with
multiple packages, inspired by Lerna for JavaScript.

### Install melos üé¨

```bash
dart pub global activate melos
```

If you see an error like `Can't load Kernel binary: Invalid SDK hash.`, you need to add the reinstall melos by re-runnung the command above. It happens after upgrading Dart SDK.

### Prepare the project for hacking üõ†

By running the following command, melos will boostrap the project:

```bash
melos prepare
```

This will install serverpod_cli and all dependencies, link all packages, and generate all necessary files and make you a cup of coffe. Or tea. Or whatever you like. üç∑?

Also `melos prepare` is a perfect command to run after pulling the project from the repository on CI.

Alternatively, you can run the following commands:

```bash
# This will install serverpod_cli
dart pub global activate serverpod_cli

# This will install all dependencies and link all packages
melos bootstrap

# This will generate all necessary files
melos gen
```

For clean generated files and build directories, you can run:

```bash
melos clean
```

**TODO**: We prefer to NOT include generated files in the repository. So, we need to add them to `.gitignore` file. Also we should add `clean.sh` script to clean generated files and directories for every package that has generated files.

## Generating files and assets üß©

To regenerate all files and assets, you can run the following commands:

```sh
melos gen
```

Alternatively, you can run the following commands:

```sh
# This will regenerate all assets
melos assetgen

# This will regenerate all files
melos codegen
```

## Running server

Before running the server you need to start docker containers:

```bash
melos docker-start
```

You can stop the containers by running:

```bash
melos docker-stop
```

Yeah, now it reporting ERROR for every docker's output (like `ERROR:  Container ohclays_server-postgres-1  Created`), but it's okay. We will fix it later.

To run the server, you can run:

```bash
melos server-start
```

It will steal your terminal, so you need to open a new terminal to run other commands. To stop the server, send SIGINT (Ctrl+C).

### Migrations

After changing the database schema, you need to generate a new migration. You can do this by running:

```bash
melos server-migrate
```

This will generate a new migration file in `ohclays_server/migrations` directory. The new migration will be applied automatically when you start the server.

## Running the app üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚Äç‚û°Ô∏è

You can use `flutter run -d [chrome|android|ios|macos]` to run the app, but there is a ready to use launch configurations in `.vscode/launch.json` for VSCode. So, enjoy!
